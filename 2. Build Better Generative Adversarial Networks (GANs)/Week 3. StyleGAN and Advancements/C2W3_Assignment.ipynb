The truncation trick resamples the noise vector $z$ from a truncated normal distribution which allows you to tune the generator's fidelity/diversity. The truncation value is at least 0, where 1 means there is little truncation (high diversity) and 0 means the distribution is all truncated except for the mean (high quality/fidelity). This trick is not exclusive to StyleGAN. In fact, you may recall playing with it in an earlier GAN notebook."

This is done by transforming it into a set of style parameters and introducing the style to the image through AdaIN. Given an image ($x_i$) and the intermediate vector ($w$), AdaIN takes the instance normalization of the image and multiplies it by the style scale ($y_s$) and adds the style bias ($y_b$).
